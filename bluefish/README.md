#### Darktooth theme for Bluefish

__*Installation*__: Bluefish doesn't provide any means for installing and loading themes in a modular fashion, so
installation is completely manual. In your Bluefish config folder, first find the file named `rcfile-2.0`. Copy the text
in the file in this repository, and paste it over the corresponding lines in the aforementioned `rcfile-2.0` file.
